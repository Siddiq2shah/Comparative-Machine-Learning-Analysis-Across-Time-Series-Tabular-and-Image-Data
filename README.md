# Comparative-Machine-Learning-Analysis-Across-Time-Series-Tabular-and-Image-Data
This repository contains a multi-dataset machine learning project developed.   The project applies supervised learning methods to three fundamentally different data modalities—time-series data, tabular demographic data, and image data, using a consistent, principled machine learning pipeline.
